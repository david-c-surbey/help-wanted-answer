<h1>ยก Hello !</h1>

I answered an advertisement for help and included this link, or otherwise: <i>Greetings!</i> Thankful to stay career-focused with customer-service and communication complimenting the education I received in college where i also got to work as a Tier 1 Helpdesk for Faculty and Staff, post-graduation, I am always looking to work in the field of computers; I love computers.

PURDUE
https://www.purdue.edu

There, taught is everything for information systems and very little professional skill to memorization. An Engineering College, they offered me a Bachelor's of Science and covered EVERYTHING regarding computers, so the 1950's to the commitment of the OSI:Technology to Consumers in the 1980's, base-level-technological-understanding. Purdue started as a college in the 1800's and was included on a course, which i loved. Networking, Servers, Desktop troubleshooting, planning Databases, and even Programming. 'Everything computer.'" By the time they could provide, when i went to school, it all up to the Internet age, you'd be astounded on how much generic coverage brings a full Information Systems Degree, that I've continued with education past a single degree there.

After I left Purdue, into the 2011's to 2018's, my focus included more bonified Sys-Admin work.

    With Systems Administration being the latter of my career focus, I learned Apple, Linux, Windows, Amazaon Cloud, Azure, V-Center, Hyper-V, MX like Exchange, Routers like Fortinet, Seagate Barracuda, gui-accesible Cisco, Comcast, and Lynksys in environment management complexity; with printers being able to be a step node away on any network, being to Administrator for upwards of thousands at any day those years had been attituded with perspective that let me learn the most. I apologized the computer wasn't working and knew to them it was a mystery to me too in minutes. They calmly let me try to resolve what once ever worked without being surprised with them that it didn't work already; my competition in employment never took seriously that their end user, from Helpdesk's perspective, couldn't be left with their complaints are meant and left meaning no complaints... if it used to work on a computer... "what gives?... it used to do, And I know since again it still doesn't"

My competition never felt more left in the dust than when they didn't know and said they did. 
Servers, the next level up, take written down to count as answers and any with want for technology help can surprise you. You'd also find triage takes exactly the emergency to solve and not be in the way. Most there did not mind myself being in focus with surprise so quickly gone as they expected each problem, as it was new, had quick resolve with adoption of responsibility you or i at the time, could guess. the rest of the computers might not, for instance, flip power break a few minutes in if you guess it all your responsibility when one does, it all might, prepare. Rare but servers are in bundles, Stacks. Half and not the other being, when they didn't take responsibility, what was wasn't written out copyable, they aren't trusted with now though, the computer machine. They lie and problems are less reported to where i ever worked after becoming a Junior Systems Admin and our departments first answer only Helpdesk (we at TPO had only a few thousand nodes), they shuffled and got left in the dust. But the best are mentioned above!
