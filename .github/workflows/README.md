<h1>ยก Hello !</h1>

I answered your advertisement for help and included this link, or otherwise: <i>Greetings!</i> Thankful to stay career-focused with customer-service and communication complimenting the education I received in college, where as i also got to work as a Tier 1 Helpdesk for Faculty and Staff post-graduation, I habitually look to work in the field of computers; I love computers.

PURDUE

<p>
  The education i received and centered around my two resumes, below. I felt at, Purdue, taught in everything for information systems and very little professional skilled into memorization of answer. Never taught a routine but taught the fundamentals repeatedly refined. An Engineering College, they offered me a Bachelor's of Science and covered EVERYTHING regarding computers, which i loved. Networking, Servers, Desktop-troubleshooting, planning Databases, and even Programming; how everything was and how it started, stuck, & re-searched as stable Software or Hardware. As i was often comfortable on the phones, a person stayed neither and computer equipment went back into operation with software and hardware all working...</p>

After I left Purdue, into the 2011's to 2018's, my focus included more bonified Sys-Admin work.

    With Systems Administration being the latter of my career focus, I learned Apple, Linux, Windows, Amazaon Cloud, Azure, V-Center, Hyper-V, MX like Exchange, Routers like Fortinet, Seagate Barracuda, gui-accesible Cisco, Comcast, and Lynksys in environment management complexity; with printers being able to be a step node away on any network, being to Administrator for upwards of thousands at any day those years had been attituded with perspective that let me learn the most. I apologized the computer wasn't working and knew to them it was a mystery to me too in minutes. They calmly let me try to resolve what once ever worked without being surprised with them that it didn't work already; my competition in employment never took seriously that their end user, from Helpdesk's perspective, couldn't be left with their complaints are meant and left meaning no complaints... if it used to work on a computer... "what gives?... it used to do, And I know since again it still doesn't"

My competition never felt more left in the dust than when they didn't know and said they did. 
Servers, the next level up, take written down to count as answers and any with want for technology help can surprise you. You'd also find triage takes exactly the emergency to solve and not be in the way. Most there did not mind myself being in focus with surprise so quickly gone as they expected each problem, as it was new, had quick resolve with adoption of responsibility you or i at the time, could guess. the rest of the computers might not, for instance, flip power break a few minutes in if you guess it all your responsibility when one does, it all might, prepare. Rare but servers are in bundles, Stacks. Half and not the other being, when they didn't take responsibility, what was wasn't written out copyable, they aren't trusted with now though, the computer machine. They lie and problems are less reported to where i ever worked after becoming a Junior Systems Admin and our departments first answer only Helpdesk (we at TPO had only a few thousand nodes), they shuffled and got left in the dust. But the best are mentioned above!
