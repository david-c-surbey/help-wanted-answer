<h1>¡ Salutaions !</h1>

Hello and I answered your advertisement for help this link, or otherwise: <i>¡Greetings!</i> With customer-service as my career focus, I habitually look to work in the field of computers; I love computers. They work right out of the box; they work with a factory reset. Guaranteed.

PURDUE
https://www.purdue.edu <a href="purdue.edu> ...here</a>

  The education I received and centered around my two resumes above, happened with Purdue. An Engineering University from the 1800's that taught in everything information systems, paper to electronic. An Engineering College, that offered me a Bachelor's of Science and covered EVERYTHING regarding computers to pick a career. Networking, Servers, Desktop-troubleshooting, planning Databases, and even Programming; how everything was and how it started, stuck, & re-searched as stable Software or Hardware. As I was often the most comfortable of the group on the phone, I picked a generalist career. I picked Junior or Jr. Systems Administration. I'd learn to answer on in emergency and keep my edge off communicating easier-than-most-computer-nerd.

After I left Purdue, into the 2011's to 2018's, my focus included more bonified Sys-Admin work and an interest in Analytics or: 'data to-the-board." '; the computers working automatically and ahead of the users decision tree presented.

With Systems Administration, I learned Apple, Linux, Windows, Amazaon Cloud, Azure, V-Center, Hyper-V, MX like Exchange, Routers like Fortinet, Seagate Barracuda, gui-accesible Cisco, Comcast, and Lynksys in environment management complexity; with printers being able to be a step node away on any network, being to Administrator for upwards of thousands at any day those years had been attituded with perspective that let me learn the most. I apologized the computer wasn't working and knew to them it was a mystery to me too in minutes. They calmly let me try to resolve what once ever worked without being surprised with them that it didn't work already; my competition in employment never took seriously that their end user, from Helpdesk's perspective, couldn't be left with their complaints are meant and left meaning no complaints... if it used to work on a computer... "what gives?... it used to do, And I know since again it still doesn't"

My competition never felt more left in the dust than when they didn't know and said they did. 
Servers, the next level up, take written down to count as answers and any with want for technology help can surprise you. You'd also find triage takes exactly the emergency to solve and not be in the way. Most there did not mind myself being in focus with surprise so quickly gone as they expected each problem, as it was new, had quick resolve with adoption of responsibility you or i at the time, could guess. the rest of the computers might not, for instance, flip power break a few minutes in if you guess it all your responsibility when one does, it all might, prepare. Rare but servers are in bundles, Stacks. Half and not the other being, when they didn't take responsibility, what was wasn't written out copyable, they aren't trusted with now though, the computer machine. They lie and problems are less reported to where i ever worked after becoming a Junior Systems Admin and our departments first answer only Helpdesk (we at TPO had only a few thousand nodes), they shuffled and got left in the dust. But the best are mentioned above!

<h3>ETLs and Extraction with Loading, Transitions</h3>

As a programmer, in Ruby on Rails and Elixir, other Object Oriented and Fully Functional having resptively harder publishing constraints, I have written software for over 7 years. From hundreds to hundreds of thousands of end-users have used my software. Mostly, my customer got a ghostwriter to put in place where they paid the overhead themselves and kept exclusive ownership of the software. Software should work that way. With the emergence of Analytics to Market software as a service, dispelling ownership became a hobby of mine. The part about understanding this and this and these: ,easily enough to boardroom help today, is true. I have covered 'our globe's staff'  on a Junior Sys. Administrator level a month confidenced into Tech; thousands of nodes all month without a change 'believed-in' for accepting responsibility for any new Urgent ticket. People would trust me with their computers while my competition fades away. i swear: they pretended it was fixed...
