greetings; Thankful to stay career-focused with customer-service and communication complimenting the education I received in college where i also got to work as a Tier 1 Helpdesk for Faculty and Staff, post-graduation, is the middle of my professional career; I loved

PURDUE
https://www.purdue.edu

They taught everything in information systems and very little professional skill to memorization. An Engineering College, they offered me a Bachelor's of Science and covered EVERYTHING regarding computers 1950's to the commitment of the OSI:Technology to Consumer explanation of up to complicated circuitry and the allowance of copyright for software. Purdue started as a college in the 1800's and was included on a course, which i loved. Networking, Servers, Desktop troubleshooting, planning Databases, and even Programming. 'Everything computer.'"
