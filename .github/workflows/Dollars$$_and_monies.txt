With work easily entertaining
$35,000/yr. and up, most
any work is respectively,
entertained. I enjoyed I.T.
being native to repair. I
enjoyed customer service
and working at any Tier.
I'd relocate...
Would temp!

Most any tech support role relies

::- Hourly

I've always loved working for whatever
hours a person has gotten a quote
from me in reasonable expectations.
They are usually thrilled when
they've handled the overhead and
we use an account, their account,
to step through what I've finished.

Billing by section, in: a-quote,
lets litte drift, I've hoped.

Quotes will total a usable hours. Real hours total'd multiplied
by a percentage of effort
true correct how
those numbers:
'eat-away.'

Mostly, my work has reasonably
rounded at $100.00/hour; from programming to speaking, a mid-range fee but usually along a project.

REAL-TIME-HOURS though, are
terribly tracked. I'll make
sure to use your time
professionally. Billable
vs real-time makes
sense for a craft.
I <3 someone else's money
<i>and with payments in
parts, that is a no-
brainer easy to be
billable-vs-realtime-with...</i>
Technology is fairly e-z.

Sincerely,

DS
