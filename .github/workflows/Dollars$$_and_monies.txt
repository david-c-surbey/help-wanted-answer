With work easily entertaining<br>
$35,000/yr. and up, most<br>
any work is respectively,<br>
entertained. I enjoyed I.T.<br>
being native to repair. I<br>
enjoyed customer service<br>
and working at any Tier.<br>
I'd relocate...<br>
Would temp!<br>

Most any tech support role relies 
on contributing to documentation
you're also searching alongside
being new to breadth expectations.



::- Hourly

I've always loved working for whatever
hours a person has gotten a quote
from me in reasonable expectations.
They are usually thrilled when
they've handled the overhead and
we use an account, their account,
to step through what I've finished.
<i>Billing by section, in: a-quote,
lets litte drift, I've hoped.</i>

Quotes will total a usable hours.

Real hours total'd multiplied<br>
by a percentage of effort<br>
true correct how<br>
those numbers:<br>
'eat-away.'<br>

Mostly, my work has reasonably
rounded at $100.00/hour;
from programming to
speaking, a mid-range fee but
usually along a project.

REAL-TIME-HOURS though, are<br>
terribly tracked. I'll make<br>
sure to use your time<br>
professionally. Billable<br>
vs real-time makes<br>
sense for a craft.<br>
I <3 someone else's money<br>
<i>and with payments in <br>
parts, that is a no-<br>
brainer easy to be<br>
billable-vs-realtime-with...</i><br>
Technology is fairly e-z.

Sincerely,<br>
DS
