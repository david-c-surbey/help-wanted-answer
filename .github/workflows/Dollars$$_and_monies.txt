With work easily entertaining 
$35,000/yr. and up, most
any work is respectively,
entertained. I enjoyed I.T.
being native to repair. I
enjoyed customer service
and working at any Tier.
I'd relocate...
Would temp!

Most any tech support role relies 
on contributing to documentation
you're also searching alongside
being new to breadth expectations.



::- Hourly

I've always loved working for whatever
hours a person has gotten a quote
from me in reasonable expectations.
They are usually thrilled when
they've handled the overhead and
we use an account, their account,
to step through what I've finished.
<i>Billing by section, in: a-quote,
lets litte drift, I've hoped.</i>

Quotes will total a usable hours.

Real hours total'd multiplied<br>
by a percentage of effort<br>
true correct how<br>
those numbers:<br>
'eat-away.'<br>

Mostly, my work has reasonably
rounded at $100.00/hour;
from programming to
speaking, a mid-range fee but
usually along a project.

REAL-TIME-HOURS though, are<br>
terribly tracked. I'll make<br>
sure to use your time<br>
professionally. Billable<br>
vs real-time makes<br>
sense for a craft.<br>
I <3 someone else's money<br>
<i>and with payments in <br>
parts, that is a no-<br>
brainer easy to be<br>
billable-vs-realtime-with...</i><br>
Technology is fairly e-z.

Sincerely,<br>
DS
